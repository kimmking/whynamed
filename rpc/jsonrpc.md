## JSON-RPC

JSON-RPC is lightweight remote procedure call protocol similar to XML-RPC. It's designed to be simple!

Me being a fan of XML-RPC of course favoured XML but I had a look at it anyways. I implemented my own json module in JavaScript? and was thinking that it would be interesting to use it for RPC Before finishing up that thought Robin Berjon said "someone should define JSON-RPC" In the evening of March 12th, I started doing exactly that.

Since 2004, there have been additional specifications and changes proposed by the members of the mailing list.

The current version of the specification can be found at [JSON-RPC 2.0](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification), which is hosted by Matt Morley (MPCM).
