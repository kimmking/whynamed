## Bower

Bower is made by lots of people across the globe, contributions large and small. Be a part of it.

Bower was created at Twitter by [@fat](https://github.com/fat) and [@maccman](https://github.com/maccman), originally released as part of [Twitterâ€™s open source effort](https://engineering.twitter.com/opensource) in 2012. Since its release, numerous individuals have made contributions. Bower is a team effort.

Bower is named after the bowerbird, a family of birds where males build a structure [the bower] and decorate it with sticks and brightly coloured objects in an attempt to attract a mate. Bower does just that. Bower brings together bits and pieces from across the forest so you can build your structure.
